Origanal Name - On 14 April 2020 - **Project Carousel USB** - On the 9th October 2020, renamed to - **Project Carousel USB: Anniversary Edition** was 2 years since THEC64 Mini NTSC was released( and I named it after 3D Arcade 10th `Anniversary Edition`).

# Now - Project Carousel USB: Standard Edition(PCUSE) and Project Carousel USB: Pro Edition(PCUPE), but it will always be PCUAE to me... :)

I have no plans of PCUAE being ported to THEA500 Full Sized(if it gets made), I do not plain to buy it, no money and I have full Sized Amigas already so it don't really interest me, I got THEA500 Mini causes its small and not in the way, just wanted you to know.

You can install PCUAE is two ways:
1. By using PCUAEManager and installing it that way(PCUSE) and its modes but not all modes will be in the manager now cause some are part of Pro version. [Download PCUAEManager here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsiWKsjhQ2jelNJtFoF1RSaRBwx5Iw?e=3s5Ja5).
2. By downloading it from the PCUAE website and installing the pro version https://projectcarouselusb.eu 

"I made this for me originally and thought it would be good to share, this was the first thing I made like this before, never really played around with Linux before, accept CommodoreOS32bit 1.3 but that was more of a theme customision then changing how Linux works, first time for everything, as they say... :), I do like to know how things work, when I was a kid I liked my C64 but I liked LEGO too so loved building stuff with it, LEGO: Technic, I would build cars or trucks by just looking at the picture of it, I never looked really at how to build it, I just looked at the picture and imagine what went where, I was 12 at the time, I still used LEGO up untill the age of 19, I loved it... :) ."

You can remove PCUAE_THEC64 or PCUAE_THEA500 folders depending on what machine you want to use PCUAE on, if you want to run PCUAE only on THEC64 then delete the PCUAE_THEA500 folder, if you want to run PCUAE on THEA500 only then delete the PCUAE_THEC64 and Games Folders, the Games folder is for THEC64 Caousel only.

PCUAE is a series of scripts and modifications, its a module program, it allows you to run games from USB on the Carousel(THEC64 Mini, THEC64 and THEVIC20 Only), and load different Modes on the machines.

For THEC64 Mini, THEC64, THEVIC20 and now THEA500 Mini. It is been developed by Spannernick.

CTRL+RESTORE â€“ Reboot the Machine(CTRL+END on THEA500 Mini on a USB Keyboard) â€“ This makes the machine reboot, not the emulator â€“ Just reboots, nothing special, you never know when you need a reboot/reset buttonâ€¦ ðŸ™‚ and it saves on you pressing the power button all the time and wearing the power button out, thats why I added it.

(THEA500)CTRL+LEFT ALT+DEL, (PCUAE)CTRL+LEFT SHIFT+F1 - Shutdown, this will power off the machine, I added it cause I was sick of pulling the power cable out all the time.

PCUAE WIKI is here, it should answer any questions you might have about PCUAE.. https://github.com/CommodoreOS/PCUAE/wiki

You can change to different Modes(Emulators) on THEA500 Mini in PCUAE Only but can not add games to its Carousel like you can with THEC64, RGL(Retro Games Ltd) have changed it on purpose so you can not add games to its carousel, proberly cause they are thinking about how much money they are making from THEA500 more then allowing the user to add there own games to the carousel, cause thats why they made the machines in the first place, to make money from them and I gusess to make sure they do not lose money, but if it was me the machines would be first and money second, but thats because I have never realy had a lot of money, I do not think of money that way, your life is more imprtant.

Its a shame, there is more to life than money, I know cause I am disabled and on a low income and I had nothing when I was a kid, in 1977(I was 6) I use to pickup toys from the street in front gardens, toys thats were thown away, I remember picking up a toy Recorad Player, a Fisher Price one with the plasic discs and took it home, cause my mum was a alcoholic so I have been there, I didn't even know what Christmas was until I was put into Foster Care in 1980, I was 9, I do not remmember a lot before 1980, I get flashbacks so like images in my head, but my mind has blocked most of it out, my mum trmatised me by screaming at me when she was drunk.
