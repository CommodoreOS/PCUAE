Whats New
=============

Whats New in PCUAE 3.3.5
===================================

PCUAE Updater has now been added to PCUAE Network Mode, if you have PCUAE connected to the internet now and is using a Ethernet Adapter with THEC64 Models/THEA500, then go into the PCUAE System Menu to check if PCUAE has any updates avalible, its been added to PCUAE 3.3.5.

PCUAE Network Mode has been updated now to included THEA500, so you can now use the internet on the machine like you can on THEC64 but it only works with one USB Ethernet Adapter, TP-Link UE300 Ethernet Adapter, I bought one and it cost me Â£16 from eBay, so if you look around you might get one cheaper, I think they were original made for Apple MacOS X because it white like there old Apple Notbooks so it goes with the colour of THEA500 Mini very well... :)

Currys sell the TP-Link UE300... https://www.currys.co.uk/products/tplink-ue300-usb-3.0-to-gigabit-ethernet-universal-adapter-10148411.html

TP-Link website, you can buy it from there too... https://www.tp-link.com/uk/home-networking/computer-accessory/ue300/

You will need a TP-Link UE300 Ethernet Adapter because it use a RealTek 1853 chip(IC) in it that THEA500 kernel only supports, you can use a 1852 too because it the same type of IC.

![TP-Link-UE300](https://i.ibb.co/RyDjgcf/20230730-141432.jpg)

You plug it in into one of THEA500 USB ports, not the one next to the HDMI port, that for your PCUAE USB Drive or USB Hub(PCUAE USB Drive is then plugged into it, like mine), you can plug it into a USB Hub but it might need powering, when I tested it in mine it didn't work becauase its not powered so I did try, the adapter does not get enought power to fuction so its light might be on but its not getting the right amount of volts, I plug it into the 2nd USB Port.

Once you pluged the adapter in to THEA500 then Open `thea500-Internet-ip.txt` in the `PCUAE USB Drive:\Network-SSID` folder to add THEA500 IP Address and the Routers Gateway IP.

You can now edit `thea500-internet-ip.txt` with notpad on windows 10, I added a program that checks it and turns it into a `Linux file`, now.
You need to add the ip address you want to use for THEA500 Mini so pick one thats free and not used by any other device on the network and looks the same.
Then add your Gateway ip, your routers IP, it needs this so THEA500 can connect to the internet.
These instructions are in the `thea500-internet-ip.txt` file too as a reminder.
Then run PCUAE and select Amiga Mode>AmigaSYS4 3.1 WinUAE Version then pick `Resoluion UAE:1280x720 RGBA` then you be able to use `IBrowse 2.4`(`IBrowse 2.5` is included, its in the other2 Amiga Hard Drive on the Workbench, you can run it from there too or move it where you want it) and load webpages in it.

And thats it... :) Internet on THEA500... :)

Added to AmigaSYS4 AmiSSL 4.5 so you can use https sites now, they now load ok.

Video is here of it working in IBrowse 2.4... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvx4wTqNels

Updated the way PCUAE loaded TheCarousels and speeded its loading time so its a bit faster, including the Modes too, I would like it to load 20 or 30 seconds but to do that I would have to change the way PCUAE boots up, I will do it some time down the line, busy with other things in PCUAE, PCUAE boot like a system so have to be carfull not to brake anything as its booting, so things not time to boot or enable like PCUAE Network Mode, I can brake something if it boots to quick so then misses something so it might not be possible, one problem with it is it has to see the PCUAE USB Drive so needs time to see it so 5 seconds so makes it take longer to boot but that can not be changed.

Look here for THEA500 Dummy Walkthrough:

https://thec64community.online/thread/1614/pcuae-walkthrough-updated-thea500



For THEC64 Models and THEA500:

PCUAE Automaticlly Updating the Firmware(THEA500 Only)
======================================================

It changes the carosel in the firmware to the one in the Carousel Changer, (it temporary changes it) Manahttan v1.0.0 to Manahttan v1.1.1 , it can be downgraded too, It can be disabled to in the PCUAE System Menu, it defauit is on.


You can uninstall PCUAE now with PCUAE REMOVER
======================================================

You can remove the Autoboot Start-Up Script if you wish too now, you can add it or remove it, you remove it using PCUAE System Menu using PCUAE REMOVER.


For THEC64 Models Only:
Loading Games in TheCarousel Amora v1.6.1(All THEC64 Models Only)
======================================================


You can load your own Games on THEC64 Carousel Amora v1.6.1, THEC64 Maxi Carousel, all THEC64 models use it now.
You can add your own games in its carousel, a set of games(for C64 and VIC20) are now inclued with PCUAE All In One Version and are included with PCUAE Manager too so you can export them to the PCUAE USB Drive, to enable PCUAE Mode on THEC64 Models you need to export over Favories 1 Gameslist to THEC64-CAROUSEL-GAMES folder on the root of THE PCUAE USB Drive for it to see the gameslists you add, you can add what games you like in the Favories 1 Gamelist in PCUAE Manager, it will need games adding to it if the carousel see no games at all it will not load the carousel, if favorites 1 is not added then a blue screen will apear and say there is no Favortes 1 Gamelist and then load the Firmware carousel with its default games instead of PCUAE Mode.


Quick Info On Modes
==================


You can run C64 or VIC20 games on THEC64 Carousel on THEC64 Mini and switch from PAL to NTSC and back on THEC64 Mini/THEC64/THEVIC20.


You can load VICE Mode and load C64 games on THEC64 and THEA500. (the pack is availble on here)


You can connect to the internet and load up BBS borads in VICE Mode in THEC64.(THEC64 Only)


You can load Amiga(16bit), Atari(8bit), Vice(C16/plus4,C64,VIC20,C128,8bit) and RetroArch(RA) Modes on THEC64 and THEA500, THEA500 can run Pandory Mode instead of RetroArch Mode(the packs are availble on here).


On THE A500 Mini - CD32 Mode, load a CD32 game from StartUp and turn THEA500 Mini into the Amiga CD32 Console, Load a ADF file in ADF Mode and load it from StartUp, like your loading a real floppy disk.


You can run AGS 500 Mode(A500 Games Selector 1.5) on THEA500 Mini from Startup, load a collection of games and apps on the Arcade Games Selector(it will need the HDD folder for it to work).


There are more features on THEC64 cause its been out longer then THEA500 Mini and its not locked down like THEA500 Mini is, I think RGL did this cause they do not like there machines being modified.



For THEC64 Models Only:
You can get to USB Media Access now from the Carousel by using the Game Slot Image for that carousel gamelist
===============================================================================================================

You can now use USB Media Access by selecting and pressing on the `Game Slot Image` on the Carousel on THEC64 Models.

Just select and press `left fire button` on the `Game Slot image`, its will show `Games Favorties 1, C64 Games, VIC20 Games` where it says what gamelist your on(its selected when you start the carousel) and it will load into `Classic Mode`(`C64 Basic` or `VIC20 Basic`) then press `Menu button` on `THEC64 joystick` on the `Basic screen` and select `Media access` and press `Left fire button` and your `USB stick/drive` content will apear on the screen, you should use this now anyway is better then the File Loader, it has more options in it like `disk swaping`, RGL should link the `USB Icon` on the `carousel` to `Media Access` anyway now because all models use it now, THEC64 does not need `two USB file loaders`, only need one... `USB Media Access`.

Here is how to do it
======================

See pictures below

On TheCarousel - Press on `left fire button` on `Game Slot image`...

![Game Slot image](https://i.ibb.co/hDBHB5X/Screenshot-2023-08-09-153743.jpg)

On Classic Mode - then press `Menu button` on `THEC64 joystick` on the `Basic screen` and select `Media Access`...

![Classic Mode](https://i.ibb.co/5jqSzrk/Screenshot-2023-08-09-153838.jpg)

Media Access - `USB stick/drive` content will apear on the screen... :).. BINGO... :D

![Media Accsess](https://i.ibb.co/YZx66Wp/Screenshot-2023-08-09-153911.jpg)

And now you can get to Media Access easier... :)


NEW PCUAE v3.3.3 now avalilble
---------
New Facebook Group now... https://www.facebook.com/groups/pcuae
-----------
Alot of work has gone in to this version to make sure everything runs as it should, thanks Davy for the help, fixing scripts and that, PCUAE is now to big for one person to work on, it would take to long to release it between versions.

New PCUAE Offical Website, finally here... https://projectcarouselusb.eu 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I changed my mind about having a site, it needs one, downloads are availble there too and other goodies.. :) you have to register on the site to download files and have access to the site, if you use the PCUAE site then you will not need to use the PCUAE Menu.

More info on PCUAE is here... https://github.com/CommodoreOS/PCUAE/wiki



For THEC64 Models Only:
About Amiga/Atari Mode(16 bit only) RA Keyboard Map
====================================================

It looks like RA is using a Frence keyboard layout, AZERTY keyboard, a keyboard layout used in France and neighboring countries.
Some keys are in the same place as a QWERTY keyboard, this is a record of where the keys are in Amiga Mode, it uses Retroarch so I have to find a way to change it to use a QWERTY keyboard map but you can not change it in Retroarch for some reason, weird.


I mapped the keyboard(checked every key) so you know where the keys are in Amiga/Atari Mode(16 bit only) so you can still use the keyboard.


What the keys are ment to be, QWERTY Keyboard(English)

            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = Backspace
             Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] #
              A S D F G H J K L ; ' Return 
	    Shift  Z X C V B N M , . / Shift
	              [  Space  ]
  
And what they are at the moment, AZERTY Keyboard(French)

	        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = Backspace
             A Z E R T Y U I O P [ ] \
              Q S D F G H J K L , # Return
	    Shift  W X C V B N ; M , / Shift
	              [  Space  ]

I hope this map helps you so you know where the keys are in Amiga/Atari Mode.
I do not know what the numberpad is like because I do not have a Keyboard with a numberpad.
This is a problem with Retroarch only not PCUAE, its using the wrong mapping for some reason, I just do not know why right now, it will take time to fix.
I will fix this as soon as I can, once I have figered it out, you can still play Pinball games OK, the shift keys have not moved or the other keys like: CTRL, A(Amiga key/ALT) and Tab keys and can still use the keyboard or you can use the Virtal Keyboard too if you like.



More info on PCUAE
===================


There is now nothing in PCUAE that not allowed to be in it, all software like `Amiga Games Selector` and `Pandory for THEA500` is not included but you can download them in the `PCUAE Menu` using there download links, you have to add them yourself to `THEA500-USB-MENU folder`, thats really easy to do, `you just open there .ZIP or RAR file` and copy its `AGS` or `Pandory` folder to the `THEA500-USB-MENU folder` and they are then installed and will work in PCUAE, its that easy.


`AMiNIMiga` has now been completely removed, I decided to remove it completely when `Amiga Workbench 3.1` was removed from THEA500 version, because I need the `Workbench 3.1 disks` so needs seting up in PCUAE to use it now to run it and it can not be set up to run normally like a `Workbench` so too much loop holes to up through, `Cloanto` probably asked him to remove it, thats would be the only reason why it been removed, its probably on to many systems thats why, I think it would of been different if it was only on THEA500 only, this is what happens when something become popular and Cloanto hear about it, this is the problem with older version of Workbench, they should be free to use in non payed products now but `AMiNIMiga` does get donations for it, that properly why no Workbench now inside it, PCUAE Does not get donations now, its now completely free, all ways of donating have now been removed, I do not need money for it, I made this because I wanted too, not for money, and the donation idea was not mine, I when a long with it thinking "OK I give a try" but it didn't work out so its better without it, work before profit, take pride in your work first before money, if you only think of the money then you lose interest in the work.


`Cloanto` are called `Amiga Corporation` now, I find that werid, they proberly changed there name so they can sell the `Amiga copyright and Games from Amiga Forever` to other companies, now they own all of it.

Ever woundered why `VICE Emulator for Windows` do not come with the `C64 kernal Roms` no more..? the `C64 Kernal Roms` were free at one time too but are not now because of `Cloanto` owning the `C64 Kernal Roms copyright` thats in `C64 Forever`, thats why `THEC64 has Cloanto` on its box, RGL had to pay them to use the `C64 Kernal Roms` in there machines.


PCUAE WILL BE SUPORTING  `AMiNIMiga` `AMM` again and added to the `THEA500-USB-MENU folder` again but no HDFs files inclued, only suporting it, you will need to add it... :)
If you want to discuss PCUAE go to THEC64 Community Forum - https://thec64community.online
"PCUAE now contains host-rum from the Pandory500 mod"... https://github.com/emuchicken/pandory-a500
It will from now on include host-rum.adf file from Pandory so it can boot PCUAE using it, thanks Dajoho and Team Pandory for alowing me to use it... :)
I will always try to support PCUAE, but do need a break from it from time to time... :)
WIKI is here, it might need updating so might not included new fetures or info on the new version of PCUAE - PCUAE Manual is here - https://github.com/CommodoreOS/PCUAE/wiki

More FAQ comming soon.

Project Carousel USB Anniversary Edition(PCUAE) by Spannernick, 


Idea by Spannernick, Carousel USB Chooser by FaberfoX(Carousel Gamelist Changer on THEC64), 


Load Carousel Games from the USB Drive using Carousel Gamelist Changer and C64 SID Music playing in the background, they change depending on what CGS is loaded, for only THEC64 Mini, THEC64 and THEVIC20, you can change it to a different set of games(Carousel Gamelist Selector - CGS) on TheCarousel.

THEA500 Mini has been block from doing it by RGL so you can not add or do anything with THEA500 Mini's TheCarousel, it will never be possable to do anything with it, sorry this is not my fault, RGL has made the carousel on purpose this way, so you can not change its games so its impossable, this is why now the next machine do not interest me now, because they be doing this to all the machines(Devices) they make and you be stuck with the games on the carousel that you will hardly play becuase you can't change them, TheCarousel is just for show and made to make the GUI look nice and to sell it, there is no purpose to the carousel realy and its not future prove, once you played the games on it a few times then you will not use it more, if you could add games to it, it be more usefull, its kind of obvious and you have no need for a USB Media Menu on the machines.

You can change to different Modes(Emulators) on THEA500 Mini in PCUAE only but can not add games to its Carousel like you can with THEC64, RGL(Retro Games Ltd) have built the carousel this way on purpose so you can not add games to its carousel, proberly cause they are thinking about how much money they are making from THEA500 more but thats why they made the machines in the first place, to make money from it and I gueses to make sure they do not lose money, I would not care if anyone moded it cause it helps selling it, like what happen to the PS Classic, hacking made it a better console and users started to buy it cause of Bleemsync.


JIFFYDOS 6 is included,
