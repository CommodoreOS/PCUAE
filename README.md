Thanks for installing PCUAE, Enjoy... :)
============================================
Original Name - On 14 April 2020 - `***Project Carousel USB***`

On the 9th October 2020, renamed to - `***Project Carousel USB: Anniversary Edition***` on THEC64 Mini NTSC 2 year Anniversary.

`Project` came from `Project Luna`, I was using `PL` on my `Sega Mega Drive Mini` at the time and it gave me the idea, and `Carousel USB` came from `Carousel USB Chooser` that Fabafox made for THEC64 that I later added to `PCUAE`

And that's how `PCUAE` got its name... :) I allways call it `PCUAE` now, its a lot easier... :)

New Facebook Group now... https://www.facebook.com/groups/pcuae

Alot of work has gone in to this version to make sure everything runs as it should, thanks Davy for the help, fixing scripts and that, PCUAE is now to big for one person to work on, it would take to long to release it between versions.

Please read this below...

About PCUAE Menu that is run from PCUAE Manger

To update the Menu, run PCUAE Manager agin or will try and update itself now when you run it.
You might need to disable your Antivirus while running this because it might delete the pcuae-update.exe file inside the PCUAE-MAIN_AIO-3.1.0-RC5-DOWNLOADER.exe so when it gets instaled on to the C: Drive, just disable it when you start PCUAE Manager and once you started to download the PCUAE you want to download then enable it again, you only need to diable the monioring part of the Antivirus so it don't remove any files, Defender on Windows removes it and you have to restore it again, it a false positive so has no virus in it.

INSTALL PCUAE-MAIN_AIO-3.1.0-RC5-DOWNLOADER.exe TO YOUR C: DRIVE, THIS IS NOT PCUAE.

THIS IS PCUAE DOWNLOAD MENU SO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF PCUAE.

IT WILL AUTOLOAD THE MENU WHEN YOU HAVE INSTALLED IT TO THE C: DRIVE IN WINDOWS.

![PCUAE MENU2](https://i.ibb.co/znVBSyB/Screenshot-2023-05-17-005550.jpg)


New site finally here... https://projectcarouselusb.eu I changed my mind about having a site, it needs one, downloads are availble there too and other goodies.. :) you have to register on the site to download files and have access to the site.


Showing the file has a virus but a false positive, anitviuses allways says it has the same virus(Trojan:Script/Wacatac.H!ml) when it don't have one, it because it can see scripts in it and its getting confused, if it looked properly it would see the scripts are for Linux only not Windows.
![PCUAE VIRUS NOT](https://i.ibb.co/72PWzd7/Screenshot-2023-05-17-215743.jpg)

There is now nothing in PCUAE that not allowed to be in it, all software like `Amiga Games Selector` and `Pandory for THEA500` is not included but you can download them in the PCUAE Menu using there download links, you have to add them yourself to `THEA500-USB-MENU folder`, thats really easy to do, `you just unpack there .ZIP file` to the `THEA500-USB-MENU folder` once they have been downloaded via the `PCUAE Menu` and they are then installed.


`AMiNIMiga` has now been completely removed, I decided to remove it completely when `Amiga Workbench 3.1` was removed from THEA500 version, because you need the `Workbench 3.1 disks` now to run it and it can not be set up to run normally like a `Workbench`, `Cloanto` proberly asked him to remove it, its proberly on to many systems thats why, I think it would of been different of it was only on THEA500 only.


`Cloanto` are called `Amiga Corporation` now, I find that werid, they proberly changed there name so they can sell the `Amiga copyright and Games from Amiga Forever` to other companies, now they own all of it.

Ever woundered why `VICE Emulator for Windows` do not come with the `C64 kernal Roms` no more..? the `C64 Kernal Roms` were free at one time too but are not now because of `Cloanto` owning the `C64 Kernal Roms copyright` thats in `C64 Forever`, thats why `THEC64 has Cloanto` on its box, RGL had to pay them to use the `C64 Kernal Roms` in there machines.


You can still add `AMiNIMiga` to the `THEA500-USB-MENU folder` and it will run, just no options to run it from startup but the `buitin Workbenches` are just as good.


If you want to discuss PCUAE go to THEC64 Community Forum - https://thec64community.online


"PCUAE now contains host-rum from the Pandory500 mod"... https://github.com/emuchicken/pandory-a500


It will from now on include host-rum.adf file from Pandory so it can boot PCUAE using it, thanks Dajoho and Team Pandory for alowing me to use it... :)


I will always try to support PCUAE, but do need a break from it from time to time... :)


WIKI is here, it might need updating so might not included new fetures or info on the new version of PCUAE - PCUAE Manual is here - https://github.com/CommodoreOS/PCUAE/wiki

# New Stuff Added


PCUAE comes with its own menu now called `PCUAE Download Menu`, you download it when you download PCUAE in PCUAE Manager(just follow what it says when you download it), you can now download different versions of PCUAE so like `PCUAE All In One(PCUAE AIO)`, `PCUAE for THEC64` or `PCUAE for THEA500`, `Modes for THEA500`, `PCUAE THEA500 Amiga CD32 Mode`, you download them via BitTorrent, it comes with Qbittorrent so you can install it if you do not have bittorrent installed yourself, if you do then you do not need to install it.


You can now download `Amiga Games Selector A500 v2.0` and `Pandory A500` as links in the menu too, when you download them just copy there files from there .zip file to `THEA500-USB-MENU` folder and thats it, you should then see them when you load up `PCUAE Mode`, you can `autoboot` them from startup using the `Mode Changer Menu`.


I made the `PCUAE Download Menu` to make it easier to download different version of PCUAE instead of just having one version on here.


I made some new boot screens now and they are now .rgba files, I made a new boot screen for THEA500 too, so it says `Retro Games` `THEA500` for 5 second then switches so it removes `Retro Games` and just shows `THEA500`, all boot screens are now updated.

It will now show what Mode is loading on the PCUAE boot screen `Now Loading, AMIGA Mode...` under the `Project Carousel USB Anniversay Edition` Boot screen.


I added some code so you see the Yellow Floppy Drive LED flash as PCUAE is loading on THEA500 Mini so you know its doing something... :)

I have now added ScummVM Mode, you can add game into the THEA500

I have no plans of PCUAE being ported to THEA500 Full Size Version(if it gets made, PCUAE might work straight out of the box, if its the same as THEA500 Mini and just bigger (like THEC64 Mini is the same as THEC64 just smaller), I do not plan on buying one, no money and I have original Amigas(A500, A600 and A1200) already so it don't really interest me, I got THEA500 Mini causes its small and not in the way and to port PCUAE to it and goes with all my other minis, just wanted you to know.


TODO: Add emulators as Modes: Atari - ST, ScummVM(added), Master System, Mega Drive, MegaCD, DOOM.


If you have any ideas you like me to try and add plaese post about them on THEC64 Community Forum, I do look at them and sometimes add a idea to PCUAE, so all ideas are welcome because you never know... :)

# Key Highlights of PCUAE:


PCUAE is not a hack, it does not hack the machines or copy over its firmware or change it, its a mod, it modifies the way the machine boots so it boots from the USB Drive using a script, it called the `Autoboot Mode Start-Up Script`(the script is part of Autoboot Mode), its in the boot folder on the PCUAE USB Drive and called `autobootfirmware.sh` and its sent to the `int.d` folder in the firmware, the same place its script is that tells it to run the carousel when the console starts up, its the Linux boot folder and is the only thing that is copied to the firmware and it can boot from the firmware or from the PCUAE USB Drive when it see it plugged in, from start up, it does not touch the firmware at all and all the modifcations added are from the USB Drive only, once you take out the drive then the machine is back to booting up from the firmware carousel from start up.

You can remove the Autoboot Start-Up Script if you wish too, you can add it or remove it, you remove it using The Mode Changer Menu or PCUAE Options Menu using PCUAE REMOVER, its now included in the PCUAE Startup Autoboot Mode.ahi in the Carousel USB Media Menu on THEA500 or in the Fake Update on THEC64 Mini/THEC64 and THEVIC20.


You can find me on YouTube too under Retronuts and on there are some videos of PCUAE - YouTube channel is here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrG1jnbvykIcLzfBFxC2GrA 


(Do not watch youtube videos from a phone or the Youtube app, you will get loads of advertisments, they play on youtube like every 10/15 minutes or so and cut into the video like your watching a TV Channel, use Google Chrome or Edge and then use the (ABP) Add Blocker Plus Extension, its free, best way to watch add free, you do not need to pay Google to watch videos on Youtube add free.)


You can run each Mode from StartUp cause PCUAE can Autoboot itself with Autoboot Mode and its Start-Up Script.


THEC64 Only:
You can load your own Games on THEC64 Carousel so add your own games to its carousel(There is a game pack availble on here too for the carousel) with PCUAE Manager, not avalible at the moment on THEA500 Mini.. :( its down to how RGL designed THEA500 Carousel on THEA500 Mini, they designed it in a way to stop you doing it, so its down to RGL not me, THEA500 Carousel needs hacking so it can do it, I am not a hacker so can not hack into it, I am a scripter.


You can run C64 or VIC20 games on THEC64 Carousel on THEC64 Mini and switch from PAL to NTSC and back on THEC64 Mini/THEC64/THEVIC20.


You can load VICE Mode and load C64 games on THEC64 and THEA500. (the pack is availble on here)


You can connect to the internet and load up BBS borads in VICE Mode in THEC64.(THEC64 Only)


You can load Amiga(16bit), Atari(8bit), Vice(C16/plus4,C64,VIC20,C128,8bit) and RetroArch(RA) Modes on THEC64 and THEA500, THEA500 can run Pandory Mode instead of RetroArch Mode(the packs are availble on here).


On THE A500 Mini - CD32 Mode, load a CD32 game from StartUp and turn THEA500 Mini into the Amiga CD32 Console, Load a ADF file in ADF Mode and load it from StartUp, like your loading a real floppy disk.


You can run AGS 500 Mode(A500 Games Selector 1.5) on THEA500 Mini from Startup, load a collection of games and apps on the Arcade Games Selector(it will need the HDD folder for it to work).


There are more features on THEC64 cause its been out longer then THEA500 Mini and its not locked down like THEA500 Mini is, I think RGL did this cause they do not like there machines being modified.



# How to Download and install PCUAE:


You can use PCUAEManager and installing it that way and its modes: [Download PCUAEManager here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsiWKsjhQ2jelNJtFoF1RSaRBwx5Iw?e=3s5Ja5).



# Where The Name Came From:


"It all started with mounting over the games on thec64 carousel, I made a script so you could start it from the fake update and change the games on the carousel so thats why it was called Project Carousel USB(named after Carousel USB Chooser)... :), the first mode I added was Vice Mode and then the Carousel Gamelist Changer scripts became PCU Mode named after its name abrivated then changed to PCUAE Mode."


# FAQ


If you hear a echo when you have loaded the carousel in PCUAE, to fix it just press and hold CTRL and then press down 0 to restart TheCarousel and it should fix it.


If you want to go back to PCUAE Mode at any time and for some reason it don't change Modes then use the Quick Shortcut back to PCUAE Mode, its:
Menu+Left Triangle Button.

On THEA500 Mini - Menu+B(Blue) buttons.

On THEC64 Mini/THEC64/THEVIC20/THEA500 Mini keyboard - CTRL+F3, 

this will not work on PCUAE Mode cause your already in the mode, this only works on any other Mode... :)


You can load other programs made for THEA500 Mini in PCUAE by puting them in the THEA500-USB-MENU folder, that where THEA500 Mini USB Drive root is now and you can add games too, ahl files can be put into THEA500-Games folder in the THEA500-USB-MENU folder.


If the program needs Firmware v1.0.0 then use Carousel Version Changer to change the Carousel to the version you need, you can use CTRL+F3 on a USB or THEC64 Keyboard or Menu+Left Triangle Button on THEC64, Menu+Y on THEGampad to load The Carousel Version Changer on PCUAE Mode only.



# What are the PCUAE Shortcut Key Combinations



For more info on the Modes in PCUAE, go to... `How to Use the Modes`, its at section 12 of the WIKI.

How To - Press and Hold Down the CTRL key and then press the key you want to use for 2 seconds in PCUAE Mode below.


CTRL+F1 – Carousel Gamelist Changer – Select one of the gamelist on the screen to load in the Carousel - Not Available on THEA500 yet.


CTRL+F3 – Carousel Version Changer – Change to a different carousel version 1.0.5,1.6.1 THEC64 or 1.0.0,1.1.1 THEA500.


CTRL+F5 – Mode Changer – Change to a different Mode(Amiga, Atari, Linux, Retroarch, VICE Modes.. etc). 


CTRL+F7 – PCUAE Options Menu – A menu with options in it for PCUAE Mode.


CTRL+RESTORE – Reboot the Machine(CTRL+END on THEA500 Mini on a USB Keyboard) – This makes the machines reboot, not the emulator – Just reboots, nothing special, you never know when you need a reboot/reset button… 🙂 and it saves on you pressing the power button all the time and wearing the power button out, thats why I added it.


(THEA500)CTRL+LEFT ALT+DEL, (PCUAE)CTRL+LEFT SHIFT+DEL - Shutdown, this will power off the machine, I added it cause I was sick of pulling the power cable out all the time on THEA500 Mini, it dose not shuttdown without the carousel running, if you press and HOLD the power button, if you hold it for more then 7 seconds it makes it do a restart and not power off(werid).




# What are THEC64 Joystick Button Combinations


Menu, Fire and the Triangle buttons – Press and Hold the Menu Button and then press the Left Fire, Right Fire or the Left, Right Triangle buttons you want to use for 2 seconds in PCUAE Mode, this makes it easier for you use PCUAE mode on THEC64 Mini, THEC64 Joystick now works in the menus on THEC64 Mini too now.


Menu+Left Triangle Button – Carousel Version Changer – Change to a different Carousel version - THEC64 Carousels 1.0.5, 1.6.1.


Menu+Right Triangle Button – Mode Changer – Change to a different Mode(Amiga, Atari, Linux, Retroarch and VICE Modes).


Menu+Left Fire 1 Button – TheCarousel Gamelist Changer – Change to a different Carousel Gamelist thats been added with the PCUAE Manager.


Menu+Right Fire 2 Button – PCUAE Options Menu – A menu with options in it for PCUAE Mode.

(Comming Soon)

Menu+C - Quick Restart - Reboot THEC64 and Activate the PAL/NTSC Video Screen on TheCarousel v1.6.1 only(not avalible on v1.0.5).

I found out this only works on THEC64 Mini not THEC64, it makes the Languges come up but the PAL/NTSC Video screen is not showing, I think its because its not seeing the HDMI so it works on THEC64 Mini cause it can not see disp device so can not detect the HDMI signal, I think it has to do with this line `mv /dev/disp /dev/disp-not` I keep digging.




# What are THEA500 THEGAMEPAD Button Combinations


Press and Hold the Menu Button and then press the A, X, Y or B buttons you want to use and hold both down for 2 seconds.

Menu+Home - Restart - Reset the Mode its on.


Menu+RSB - Quick Switch - Switch between Amiberry 3.3 and 5.3 and back in the carousel.



# How do you add games to AMIGA Mode


PCUAE will have a new folder in PCUAE 3.1.0 that is for Amiga Games only and you be able to put the game files in a HDF file so you will need to use `WinUAE` to copy them to the HDF file to add more and the HDF file is 1.95GB.
Download `WinUAE` from here, you can use the latest version... https://www.winuae.net/download/


PCUAE will have a folder in it called `WHDLoad-Games` on the root of the USB Drive, it will have a HDF file in it, this is where you put your Amiga games, you have to load Workbench in `WinUAE` and then add the `WHDLoad-Games-1.hdf` file first then copy them over that way.
Add the `WHDLoad` Games that are in `LHA` format in `WinUAE` so put them in a folder and then add the folder to `WinUAE` and then extract them to the `WHDLoad-Games-1.hdf` drive that will be in the `WHDLoad-Games` folder using Directry Opus so then they are unpacked properly.


DO NOT use Winrar to unpack WHDLoad Games in LHA format, you will mess them up and they will not load.


More FAQ comming soon.

Project Carousel USB Anniversary Edition(PCUAE) by Spannernick, 


Idea by Spannernick, Carousel USB Chooser by FaberfoX(Carousel Gamelist Changer on THEC64), 


Load Carousel Games from the USB Drive using Carousel Gamelist Changer and C64 SID Music playing in the background, they change depending on what CGS is loaded, for only THEC64 Mini, THEC64 and THEVIC20, you can change it to a different set of games(Carousel Gamelists Screens - CGS) on TheCarousel.

THEA500 Mini has been block from doing it by RGL so you can not add or do anything with THEA500 Mini's TheCarousel, it will never be possable to do anything with it, sorry this is not my fault, RGL has made the carousel on purpose this way, so you can not change its games so its impossable, this is why now the next machine do not interest me now, because they be doing this to all the machines(Devices) they make and you be stuck with the games on the carousel that you will hardly play becuase you can't change them, TheCarousel is just for show and made to make the GUI look nice and to sell it, there is no purpose to the carousel realy and its not future prove, once you played the games on it a few times then you will not use it more, if you could add games to it, it be more usefull, its kind of obvious and you have no need for a USB Media Menu on the machines.

You can change to different Modes(Emulators) on THEA500 Mini in PCUAE only but can not add games to its Carousel like you can with THEC64, RGL(Retro Games Ltd) have built the carousel this way on purpose so you can not add games to its carousel, proberly cause they are thinking about how much money they are making from THEA500 more but thats why they made the machines in the first place, to make money from it and I gueses to make sure they do not lose money, I would not care if anyone moded it cause it helps selling it, like what happen to the PS Classic, hacking made it a better console and users started to buy it cause of Bleemsync.


JIFFYDOS 6 is included, 


**This is free for non commercial use - NOT to SELL and will allways be FREE, if you have bought PCUAE from someone(eBay) ask for your money back**
