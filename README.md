Origanal Name - On 14 April 2020 - **Project Carousel USB** - On the 9th October 2020, renamed to - **Project Carousel USB Anniversary Edition** was 2 years since THEC64 Mini NTSC was released( and I named it after 3D Arcade 10th `Anniversary Edition`, something else I made... :) ).

# Now - Project Carousel USB Anniverasy Edition: Basic(PCUAEB), Project Carousel USB Anniverasy Edition: Standard (PCUAES) and Project Carousel USB Anniverasy Edition: Premium(PCUAEP). Standard version will be availble here only.

I have no plans of PCUAE being ported to THEA500 Full Size Version(if it gets made, PCUAE might work out of the box if its the same as THEA500 Mini and just bigger), I do not plain on buying one, no money and I have full sized Amigas already so it don't really interest me, I got THEA500 Mini causes its small and not in the way so goes with all my other minis, just wanted you to know.

# Key Highlights of PCUAE:


You can run each Mode from StartUp cause PCUAE can Autoboot itself with Autoboot Mode.

You can load Games on THEC64 Carousel so add your own games to its carousel, not avalible at the moment on THEA500 Mini.. :(

You can run C64 or VIC20 games on THEC64 Carousel on THEC64 Mini and switch from PAL to NTSC and back on THEC64.

You can load VICE Mode and load C64 games on THEC64 and THEA500.

You can connect to the internet and load up BBS borads in VICE Mode in THEC64(Premium).

You can load Amiga(16bit), Atari(8bit), Vice(8bit) and (RA)RetroArch Modes on THEC64 and THEA500, THEA500 can run Pandory Mode instead of RetroArch Mode.

On THE A500 Mini - CD32 Mode, load a CD32 game from StartUp and turn THEA500 Mini into the Amiga CD32 Console(Premium), Load a ADF file in ADF Mode and load it from StartUp, like your loading a real floppy disk.

You can run AGS Mode(A500 Games Selector 1.4) on THEA500 Mini from Startup, load a collection of games and apps on the Arcade Games Selector.


There are more features on THEC64 cause its been out longer then THEA500 Mini.



# You can install PCUAE is two ways:


1. By using PCUAEManager and installing it that way(PCUAES) and its modes but not all modes will be in the manager now cause some are part of Premium version(PCUAEP). [Download PCUAEManager here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsiWKsjhQ2jelNJtFoF1RSaRBwx5Iw?e=3s5Ja5).
2. By downloading it from the PCUAE website and installing the PCUAEP version https://projectcarouselusb.eu 

"It all started with mounting over the games on the carousel, I made a script so you could start it from the fake update and change the games on the carousel so thats why it was called Project Carousel USB... :), the first mode I added was Vice Mode and then the carousel Gamelist changer scripts became PCUAE Mode named after its name abrivated."


PCUAE is a series of scripts and modifications, its a module program, it allows you to run games from USB on the Carousel(PCUAE Mode - THEC64 Mini, THEC64 and THEVIC20 Only), and load different Modes on the machines.

For THEC64 Mini, THEC64, THEVIC20 and now THEA500 Mini. It is been developed by Spannernick.



TIPS
=====

If you want to go back to PCUAE Mode at any time and for some reason it don't change Modes then use the Quick Shortcut back to PCUAE Mode, its Menu+Left Triangle Button or on THEA500 Mini - Menu+B(Blue) buttons or on THEC64 Mini/THEC64/THEVIC20/THEA500 Mini keyboard - CTRL+F3.

You can remove PCUAE_THEC64 or PCUAE_THEA500 folders depending on what machine you want to use PCUAE on, if you want to run PCUAE only on THEC64 then delete the PCUAE_THEA500 folder, if you want to run PCUAE on THEA500 only then delete the PCUAE_THEC64 and Games Folders, the Games folder is for THEC64 Caousel only.

You can use PCUAE Manager to manage your games on the Carousel and store them, import/export them from/to the PCUAE USB Drive(THEC64 ONLY).

PCUAE Manager - https://thec64community.online/thread/603/pcuae-manager

PCUAE WIKI is here, it should answer any questions you might have about PCUAE.. https://github.com/CommodoreOS/PCUAE/wiki

You can change to different Modes(Emulators) on THEA500 Mini in PCUAE only but can not add games to its Carousel like you can with THEC64, RGL(Retro Games Ltd) have built the carousel this way on purpose so you can not add games to its carousel, proberly cause they are thinking about how much money they are making from THEA500 more but thats why they made the machines in the first place, to make money from it and I gusess to make sure they do not lose money, I would not care if anyone hacked it cause hacking helps sales, like what happen to the PS Classic, hacking made it a better console and peolpe started to buy it cause of Bleemsync.

ANYWAY....PEACE PEOPLE... :) and Enjoy using PCUAE.

Spannernick.
